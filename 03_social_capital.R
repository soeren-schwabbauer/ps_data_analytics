##### START REPORT #############################################################

# For the following report, we shall have a look at how the subjective well-being 
# (SWB), namely general happiness and life satisfaction, are linked to Social Capital

# In order to take a closer look at the SWB, we shall take the term of the Social 
# Capital into account. The literature shows that Social Capital is an important 
# factor for increasing the level of SWB. But first of all, what is Social Capital?
#
# Social capital can be seen as "a positive product of human interaction" 
# (investopedia.com). While it can not be owned by somebody, it is the result of 
# connections between individuals within social networks. Social capital can be 
# seen as a base pillar for the effective functioning of social groups. The absence 
# of Social capital can mislead a group of people to not achieve a common goal or purpose.
#
# Despite its undeniable value for any group of individuals, there is no consensus 
# on how social capital can be measured directly. This leads to the conclusion, 
# that social capital can only be expressed through other indicators. The European 
# Value Study (EVS) includes several indicators which can help to determine a 
# countries Social Capital 
#
# In the following, we are going to consider trust as a key dimension for social 
# capital. The EVS sees the trust variable as an indication whether most people 
# can be trusted or not. in particular, the people participating in the survey get 
# asked the following question: Generally speaking, would you say that most people 
# can be trusted or that you canâ€™t be too careful in dealing with people? 
# The answer is then separated into two possible answers (1) "Most people can be trusted" 
# and (2) "Can't be too careful". In the following diagram, we are going to provide 
# an overview of the responses of the qualitative variable.

# Looking at the graph, it is hard to establish a clear trend within the data.
# Starting with the "Happiness" part of the diagram, it can roughly be said, 
# that those who are very or quite happy with their lives tend to trust their
# fellow citizens more on average.
#
# A similar trend cannot really be observed in the case for satisfaction.
# Here, dissatisfied participants seem to trust their fellow citizens more.
# While there are differences in the level of trust, it's not possible to 
# observe a trend.
#
# Furthermore it needs to be stated, that the overall level of trust rarely 
# exceeds 20% with a maximum of 30% being reached only once.


# Besides the trust factor, analyzing "weak ties" can also help to get an 
# impression of the Social Capital among the Romanian people. The term weak 
# ties implies connections among individuals which one does not know very well, 
# but by whom one is surrounded on a regular basis. In the EVS, the interviewers 
# asked the participants weather they are a member of various groups. Let us 
# therefore first have a very general overview on how the membership in any 
# group can impact happiness and or life satisfaction. 
#
# Note: for a better overview, the level of satisfaction has been grouped into 
# 1: 'Not satisfied at all', 
# 2-5: 'Not very satisfied', 
# 6-9: 'Quite satisfied', 
# 10: 'Very satisfied'.

# Starting off with charitable causes we can see that those who mentioned being 
# a member of a charitable organisation reported to be quite happy or very happy 
# more often.
#
# Being a member of a labor union also seems to have a certain connection to
# happiness as union members more often reported to be quite or very happy as 
# opposed to non-members.
#
# Interestingly, being a member of a religious organisation doesn't seem to 
# increase happiness for all participants. It can be observed that those who are
# religious more often reported to be not very happy but at the same time 
# religious respondents more often reported to be very happy. One way of 
# interpreting this would be to assume that being religious could have a diverging
# effect on people and either increase or decrease their happiness according to 
# some other external variable.
#
# Looking at the variable of being a member of a self-help group, the graphs don't
# diverge as much as for other variables. Those who are members of a self-help
# group have a little more frequently reported to be quite happy than those who are
# not, but the effect is very small.
#
# Looking at sports groups, the effect on happiness seems to be surprisingly
# large. Those who reported to be members of sports groups are to a large extent
# either very happy or at least quite happy overall. Those two groups together 
# constitute over 90% of those reporting to be member of a sports group or team.
#
# Finally, being a member of an activity. This seems to be connected to the effect
# of happiness as those who have reported to be member of any sort of activity 
# rarely mentioned to be not very happy or not at all happy. Over 90% of respondents
# who mentioned to be member of an activity reported to be either very or at least
# quite happy. 
# It can be assumed, that this effect is similar to the one observed for sports
# groups, as the graph for overall activities strongly mirrors the one for sports
# groups.

# We assume that weak ties also appear in the neighborhood. Since neighbors are 
# in some way silent, but steady companions, we find it highly important to look 
# at what impact a certain neighborhood can have on the the trust the questioned 
# people have in them.

# Starting off with drinking neighbors. To most people it doesn't really seem
# to matter if their neighbors are drinkers or not. The two graphs barely differ
# from each other. There is a small group of respondents that responds with
# "trust somewhat" as opposed to "trust completely" if their neighbors are 
# drinkers, but the effect is too small to be investigated further.
# 
# Being a drug addict however, seems to have a more significant effect. The picture
# is similar to drinking, but a larger percentage of respondents reports to not
# trust their neighbors very much if they are drug addicts.
# 
# The case for homosexuality however is an interesting one. There seems to be 
# a rather large group of respondents that chooses not to trust their neighbors
# very much as opposed to trusting them somewhat, if they happen to be homosexuals. 
# On the other hand, there is also a group of respondents which increase the
# trust in their neighbors from trusting them somewhat to trusting them completely.
# Having homosexual neighbors therefore seems to have a split effect on the 
# Romanian citizens, depending on an external variable.
# 
# Having immigrant neighbors seems to enhance the trust that Romanian citizens
# have in them. This seems to be a uniform effect for all citizens. There is a 
# larger percentage of citizens reporting to trust their neighbors completely
# as well more citizens trusting them at least somewhat if they happen to be 
# immigrants.
#
# Neighbors having a different race seems to polarize the Romanian people to a 
# small but visible extent. There is a larger percentage of respondents reporting
# to trust their neighbors completely as well as a larger percentage of citizens
# not trusting their neighbors at all if they have a different race.

# Furthermore, weak ties also appear within a religion. Individuals which share 
# similar interests, such as the same god, implicitly see each other on a regular 
# basis when attending a church service. The following two mosaic plots shall 
# provide an overview on how the attendance of a church service might affect the 
# level of SWB, as we assume, that weak ties have a positive effect on the Social 
# capital and therefor on the level of SWB.

# very much from each other, with one exception. It can be seen, that those
# who practically never attend church report to be not very happy a little 
# more frequently than those who (for instance) attend church more than once
# a week. This effect however is not visible when switching to life 
# satisfaction. Overall, the effect doesn't seem to be strong  enough to 
# speculate a connection between church attendance and happiness or satisfaction.
